- Status: :x: **error** — no `output {}` block found; still relies on the legacy `publishDir` directive

This report tracks migration from the legacy `publishDir` directive to the new [workflow outputs](https://docs.seqera.io/nextflow/tutorials/workflow-outputs) syntax.

## Workflow `output {}` blocks

No top-level `output {}` block found. See the docs for how to add one:
https://docs.seqera.io/nextflow/tutorials/workflow-outputs

## Legacy `publishDir` references

Found 2 `publishDir` references across 1 file that should be migrated to the workflow `output {}` block:

- [`conf/modules.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/datasync/blob/04eae404dcbc433b9bc599d92fafff6bff056c7e/conf/modules.config#L15) — 2 references
