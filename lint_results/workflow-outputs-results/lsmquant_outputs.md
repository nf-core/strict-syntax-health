## Workflow `output {}` blocks

No top-level `output {}` block found. See the docs for how to add one:

## Legacy `publishDir` references

Found 5 `publishDir` references across 1 file that should be migrated to the workflow `output {}` block:

- [`conf/modules.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/lsmquant/blob/599df9c144fe45c31c2015dc8535a4c82fb850bd/conf/modules.config#L15) — 5 references
