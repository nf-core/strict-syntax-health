## Workflow `output {}` blocks

No top-level `output {}` block found. See the docs for how to add one:

## Legacy `publishDir` references

Found 39 `publishDir` references across 1 file that should be migrated to the workflow `output {}` block:

- [`conf/modules.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/spatialaxe/blob/af4d5a93dab5d583515f974b3016bd99520d7ff3/conf/modules.config#L15) — 39 references
