This report tracks migration from the legacy `publishDir` directive to the new [workflow outputs](https://docs.seqera.io/nextflow/tutorials/workflow-outputs) syntax.

## Workflow `output {}` blocks

No top-level `output {}` block found. See the docs for how to add one:

## Legacy `publishDir` references

Found 15 `publishDir` references across 1 file that should be migrated to the workflow `output {}` block:

- [`conf/modules.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/fastquorum/blob/0cba208a2e8c70d525ddb5d99df05ff3bb760cfc/conf/modules.config#L15) — 15 references
